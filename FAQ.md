  * **What is SLM Machine?**
SMG LAN Messenger is an open source,cross platform, small, lightweight, instant messenger developed for in company use with encryption support. It is specifically designed for **low network** traffic. Since SMG LAN Messenger is based on [P2P architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), there is no need to server. Clients can directly communicate each other.

  * **Why do we need SLM Machine?**
Main idea behind SLM is to achieve colleague communication with minimum network load. It is espacially designed for low network traffic. Similar LAN messengers are using [UDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) broadcasting to find online peers, SLM on the other hand eliminates broadcast messaging. This makes unnecessary network loads and might be detected by firewalls or IT guys. For these restrictions in the secure company intranets many conventional messengers are useless. In SLM, buddy list is constructed manually by entering an alias and corresponding IP address or Host Name of the buddy.
